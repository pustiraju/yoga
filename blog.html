          <p>In today’s fast-paced world, the search for balance and inner peace has become more essential than ever. Many people are turning to yoga for wellbeing as a reliable and holistic practice to improve both physical and mental health. Yoga is more than just a form of exercise — it is a way of life that promotes harmony between the mind, body, and spirit.
Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, integrating yoga into your daily routine can lead to a healthier, happier, and more fulfilling life. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of yoga for wellbeing, how it works, different yoga styles, and practical tips to get started.</p>
          <!-- <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Physical Benefits</h4>
          <p>Daily yoga strengthens muscles, improves posture, and increases flexibility. Poses like Downward Dog and Warrior II engage multiple muscle groups, promoting overall fitness. Regular practice also enhances balance and reduces the risk of injury.</p>
          <p>Moreover, yoga supports cardiovascular health. Dynamic styles like Vinyasa can elevate heart rate, while restorative poses lower blood pressure and promote relaxation.</p>
          <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Mental and Emotional Benefits</h4>
          <p>Yoga is a powerful tool for stress relief. Practices like mindful breathing and meditation calm the nervous system, reducing cortisol levels. This leads to improved focus, better sleep, and a greater sense of emotional balance.</p>
          <p>By fostering mindfulness, yoga helps you stay present, reducing anxiety and enhancing your overall quality of life. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced practitioner, just 15–30 minutes daily can make a significant difference.</p>

        <div class="text-gray-700 space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit word yuj, which means "to unite" or "to join." It symbolizes the union of the individual self with the universal consciousness.
Yoga combines physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation, and ethical practices to promote physical health, mental clarity, emotional stability, and spiritual growth. It is widely recognized not only as a form of exercise but also as a tool for enhancing overall wellbeing.</p>
          <!-- <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Getting Started</h4> -->
          <!-- <p>Find a quiet space and sit comfortably. Close your eyes and focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, then exhale slowly. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath. Start with just 5 minutes a day.</p> -->
          <!-- <p>Guided meditations, available through apps or online videos, can also help. They provide instructions and calming music to ease you into the practice.</p> -->
          <!-- <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Benefits of Meditation</h4> -->
          <!-- <p>Regular meditation reduces anxiety, improves concentration, and promotes emotional resilience. Studies show it can even enhance creativity and problem-solving skills. Over time, you’ll notice a greater sense of inner peace.</p> -->
          <!-- <p>At Yoga Samadhan, we offer beginner-friendly meditation classes to help you build a sustainable practice. Join us to discover the calm and clarity meditation can bring.</p> -->
